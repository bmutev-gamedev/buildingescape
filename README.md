# Building Escape
---
This repository houses my game project for a puzzle type game Building Escape. This game was started during my course at Udemy - "The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ & Make Games", found [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubDiscount), led by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi. Later I have built upon it a bit and as of now this is not yet a full fledget game. It is missing quite a bit of things such as a game menu, an options menu, more levels, atleast a basic multiplayer and so on.

## Technical information
The game has been created with UnrealEngine 4.13.2 and VisualStudio 2015. It is written mainly in C++ but I also have taken advantage of the blueprint system when controlling doors and lights.

## The Game
The game is played from a first person perspective. The goal is for the player to find a way to reach and interact with a console found in a chamber room. To do that, the player has to move and place objects at certain places, interact with objects in certain sequence so that the door between rooms can be opened. In the end of the level the player has to deactivate a sphere field around the console to reach it.
